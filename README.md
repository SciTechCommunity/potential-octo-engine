# Welcome To *A Terrible Idea*
- Multiple Members
- Multiple Languages
- Multiple Paradigms
- Multiple Frameworks
- Multiple Platforms
- Multiple Servers
- All together as one

## An Experimental Project
We want people with different backgrounds, levels of experience, and preferred languages to be able to work together on an appropriately sized project. Everyone in CSST is welcome, **NAY** encouraged, to join. The Project? **_A Social Gaming Network!_**

## The Setup
Users will be able to join one of 2 teams and duke it out in popular games such as Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, Uno, and more! *The catch?* We're doing this "Twitch Plays" style!  

Everyone can submit their move from their app. After all or most of the players moves have been sent, a move will be picked by _Popularity_ (**Democracy**) or _at Random_ (**Anarchy**). Then the move will be processed by a Game Server and the users will be updated.

## How the Shit!?
1. There is a _User_ **U**.
2. **U** sends a mostly valid move to a _Server_ **X**.
3. **X** validates the **U** against a _Server_ **D**.
3. **X** validates a move against a _Server_ **S**.
4. **X** passes the totally valid move to a _Server_ **Q**.
5. **X** stores the move in **S**
5. After some set interval, **Q** will select a move based on the game mode.
6. **Q** passes the chosen move to a _Server_ **B**.
7. **B** performs a final validation step and then plays the move.
8. **B** passes the new game state and the chosen move to **S**.
9. Once **S** has finally changed, **U** updates the game info.

## Who, What, When, Where, and Why?
